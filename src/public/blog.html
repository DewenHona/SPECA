                rumoured! <span id="blog-date">14 Dec, 2018.</span></div>
            <br>

            It’s starting to look like Nvidia will have more than mobile versions of its GeForce RTX graphics at
            CES
            2019 as there’s a fresh leak about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060.

            Videocardz’s spies at Gigabyte released a photo of their version of the upcoming GeForce RTX 2060
            alongside
            some specs. The card purportedly features the TU106 GPU we expected alongside 1920 CUDA cores, 6GB of
            GDDR6
            memory and a maximum frequency of 1,200MHz.

            Comparatively, the Nvidia GTX 1060 featured 1280 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR5 memory (GDDR5X after a recent
            refresh) and a boost clock of 1,708MHz.

            The RTX 2060 lower rumored maximum frequency has us a little worried. However, every GPU in the Nvidia
            Turing series so far has also featured lower overall clockspeeds but still far greater performance over
            their predecessors.

        <div id="blog-post">
            <div id="blog-post-title">Will the AMD's next Navi GPU's beat Nvidia's Ray-Tracing line up?<span id="blog-date">27
                    Dec, 2018.</span></div>
            <br>
            AMD will reportedly use a new nomenclature for its future graphics cards. The first batch of Navi products
            will launch with the Radeon RX 3000 moniker as opposed to the RX 600-series naming scheme. From a marketing
            perspective, this would make a lot of sense. By claiming the 3000-series branding, AMD would effectively
            lock Nvidia out from using it for the successors of the GeForce RTX 20-series of gaming graphics cards,
            while also matching up with AMD's upcoming Ryzen 3000 CPUs. And given how much success AMD has had lately
            with its Ryzen CPUs, it makes sense from a branding perspective hitch its new graphics cards to the CPU
            wagon.

            <div id="blog-post-title">Do you prefer one brand over another? <span id="blog-date">15 Dec, 2018.</span></div>
            <br>

            There are so many brands out there, some of which we may never know. Thankfully computer
            hardware
            components do not have that many selection of brands only few of the top ones ae prefers. Do
            you
            know any brands which are not known to many people but needs attention ?
