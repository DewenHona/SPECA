Video editing require the power of the high clock rates or the processr and more cores will benefit render times and overall workflow of the project. Overclocking or not based on your choice approriate processor has been suggesed to you.",

With respect to your editing, this motherboard is the one you are looking for. Proper considerations like your usage and how many slots you might require for components, this motherboard will satsify all you needs.",

Well here is a news for you, most softwares used for video editing benefit from gpu cores at a considerable amount. Plus one cannot go wrong with having a graphic card in system. However a powerful one is not required but just about enough to get the jon done. The graphic for video edting has been sugguested consider everything. ",

For most editing applications  rendering a big video file is quite hard for a tradtional storage device.

You need to select a case size that will fit and be compatible with your other components. Most of the components have slots that they need to fit in as well, so your PC case will need to provide enough of these for your components to fit inside with room for air flow.
